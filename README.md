# Selectors for Browser Extension Development 

Volunteers are relatively scarces, who write for example custom uBlock rules AND publish them AND update them. 
We can keep these updated as a TSV for everybody at once.  
Only a few 100 entries could speed up /improve 10000 relevant project's development.  
We can let predictions, automated testing and AI assist us.

example:

| element | selector | comment | common actions |
|---------|---------|---------|-----|
| youtube endscreen |  .ytp-fullscreen-grid-stills-container  |  Changed in October 2025? | display:none, <br> transform: scale(0.5) |
